#### Incentive Bonus

Merchants receive an incentive bonus from the requester's end. Some important points are listed below.

- Incentive bonus is determined by the total value of the items you're trading for. It's not counted separately for each item.
- If a merchant requests for items, they should also pay the incentive. For merchant-merchant trade, the requester sends first. For merchant-member trade, the member sends first, even if the merchant is the requester. The member will receive incentive.
- If the trade value exceeds 10,000, there will be a separate incentive bonus. For example, if the trade value is 12,000, the merchants will receive an extra bonus of 500 for the additional 2,000 according to our incentive bonus table. The bonus for each trade value is listed below.

#### Artrade Trading Rules

During a trade, merchants and requesters must follow the trading rules listed below.

- We highly recommend that requesters only trade with our merchants, and not the members.
- Requesters need to send the full amount (including bonus) before merchants can proceed with their part.
- Both parties are only allowed to exchange items, and must not involve any other types of exchanges.
- Both parties are advised to take screenshots or screen recordings during a trade.
- If there's an issue, you must report to the group owners.

<div class="linebreak"></div>

## 3. Scam Insurance

- You must be a member of the group to claim the insurance.
- The insurance only applies when trading with one of our merchants.
- The insurance does not cover trade value exceeding 10,000 coins.
